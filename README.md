# Calendar_Keeper
An application to help users block time in a calendar.
Single-day calendar includes hours 9AM-5PM for a typical workday. Each hour block is color-coded to reflect if time has passed prior to the current hour. The page itself refreshes every minute to ensure that the current hour is accurately reflected. User is able to input a task within each time block to keep track.
